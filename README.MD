# Face the Canvas!

##Design challenges
One of our design challenges was finding a way to help the users to place their face in the right position. For this task, we use PoseNet. PoseNet allows a complete Pose Estimation. PoseNet is a pre-trained model, available with the ml5.js library and the p5.js library, that track the body in the browser in real time. Thus, we have a series of sets of coordinates, which can be used for our purposes.

We suggest the user to match his eyes and nose with some circles, that represent the correct positions for the nose and the eyes in that specific part of the canvas. The circles change their color, from red to green, when the distance between the user's eye or nose is close enough to the correct position.
